# stock-analysis

# I've submitted my code as both a .bas file and a .txt, as I wasn't sure which would be easier to access for grading purposes.
# Included are screenshots of the code working as intended on all three sheets of the workbook.
# I had to run the code twice to populate all the desired fields. I'm sure I made a small error somewhere but I wanted to submit on time and not risk handing in nothing at all.
# I also wasn't really sure what to put in this readme, so I'll just say thanks for your time!
